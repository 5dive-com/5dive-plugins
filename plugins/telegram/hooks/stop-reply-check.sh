# Stop hook: catch the "Telegram inbound this turn, no reply tool call" slip
# and either auto-relay the assistant's transcript text, block the Stop so
# the agent retries, or curl a diagnostic — depending on what's in the
# transcript.
#
# Why: claude agents paired over Telegram sometimes "talk to the transcript"
# instead of calling mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__reply. The MCP guidance
# is loaded every turn but easy to skim — especially for short answers that
# feel like chat. Prompt-level reminders haven't been enough; this hook is
# the safety net.
#
# Decision tree (when had_inbound this turn):
#   reply/edit_message sent this turn        → exit clean (proper channel used;
#                                              any loose transcript text is just
#                                              narration — do NOT relay it)
#   no send, transcript text present         → curl "(auto-relay) <text>"
#                                              (genuine "talked to the
#                                              transcript instead of replying")
#   no send, no text, react-only             → exit clean (intentional ack)
#   no send, no text, no tool, first time    → JSON {decision:"block"} (retry)
#   no send, no text, no tool, re-entry      → curl enriched diagnostic
#
# A "send" is reply OR edit_message — react/download_attachment don't count,
# since a 👍 isn't a text answer. Deciding at the turn level (did the agent
# reach the proper channel at all?) rather than per-text-block is what stops
# preambles and end-of-turn summaries leaking out after the real reply.
#
# Loop safety (three layers — any one is sufficient):
#   1. payload.stop_hook_active=true set by the harness on Stop re-invocation
#      after a block. We never emit another block in that path.
#   2. /tmp/5dive-stopblock-<sha1(transcript_path)>.lock written when we
#      block, removed when re-entry runs. Belt-and-suspenders if the
#      harness flag is ever absent — once the lock exists, the empty-text
#      branch falls through to the diagnostic instead of blocking again.
#   3. Block decision is only emitted on the empty-text branch, so a model
#      producing any text will hit auto-relay and never loop.
# Worst case: 2 hook invocations per Stop event, both bounded by timeout: 10.
#
# Auto-registered via the plugin manifest (hooks/hooks.json) — fires only
# in sessions where this plugin is enabled. Token is read from
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN; the plugin's /telegram:configure skill writes it to
# ~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env, which the MCP server picks up at start.

# Allow buffered transcript writes to settle before we read. Node's

# Normal path: analyze current turn. A turn starts at the most-recent entry
# where type=user AND .message.content is a STRING — that pattern is the
# initial real user/channel prompt (tool_result feedback also has type=user
# but content is an array, so it's excluded). Within the turn:
#   - had_telegram_inbound: any user content (initial OR system-reminder
#     embedded in a tool_result) contains a telegram <channel> block. The
#     channel plugin injects "A message arrived while you were working"
#     system-reminders into tool_results, so mid-turn inbounds count.
#   - had_telegram_tool_call: any assistant tool_use called one of the
#     mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__{reply,react,edit_message} tools. Any
#     of those satisfies the "something reached Telegram" rule — a pure
#     reaction-only turn (e.g. acking a status ping) is intentional.
#   - texts: every non-empty assistant text block in the turn, in order.
#     We auto-relay every block past relayed_count from the state file;
#     joining all-unrelayed beats picking just the last one, which used
#     to miss text emitted before mid-turn tool calls.
#   - last_chat_id / last_message_id: chat_id and message_id from the
#     most-recent inbound — chat is who we relay to; message_id goes into
#     the block reason / diagnostic so the operator can identify which
#     message went unanswered.
