# PreToolUse hook for telegram-relayed claude agents.
#
# Why: AskUserQuestion (numbered-options picker) and ExitPlanMode
# (plan-approval picker) render in the local tmux pane only — Telegram
# users never see them, and the agent blocks waiting for keyboard input
# that never arrives. Deny these tool calls with feedback instructing
# claude to inline the question/plan in a normal Telegram reply.
#
# Auto-registered via the plugin manifest (hooks/hooks.json) — fires only
# in sessions where this plugin is enabled (i.e. telegram-paired).
